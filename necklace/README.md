# An RGB LED Necklace reacts to your heartbeat
This necklace uses the Pulse Sensor from World Famous Electronics which can be seen [text here](https://www.amazon.com/Pulse-Sensor-PulseSensor-864620000204/dp/B01CPP4QM0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1487820372&sr=8-1&keywords=heartbeat+sensor) copuled with the NeoPixel Lights from AdaFruit.

## Getting Started 
Go to the World Famous Electronics GitHub page here [text here](https://github.com/WorldFamousElectronics/PulseSensor_Amped_Arduino) and get a heartbeat working correctly. This project will blink and fade an LED to a users heart rate.

## Next Steps
Go to the class parts list and find the parts for a FLORA, batteries and NEOPixels. Based on what you've learned can you use this instead of the Arduino UNO? Can you blink and LED on the FLORA and what inputs do you need for the HeartBeat sensor and what outputs for the NeoPixel? Can you run a NEOPixel project on it?
